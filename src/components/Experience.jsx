                    As a Marketing Director, I <strong>lead weekly meetings</strong>, delegate tasks effectively, and
                    facilitate brainstorming sessions to drive creativity and collaboration. <br />
                    <br />
                    I manage a team of <strong>4</strong>, coordinate marketing efforts across multiple platforms and
                    boosted account engagement by <strong>278.1%</strong> in one month. <br />
                    Oversaw content strategy that increased follower growth by <strong>150%</strong> and improved
                    average post reach by <strong>200%</strong>. <br />
                    <br />
                    Strengthened my skills in <em>leadership, communication, problem-solving, and adaptability </em>
                    while ensuring campaigns were delivered on time and aligned with club goals.

                    I created and manage my own <strong>YouTube channel</strong> as a
                    <em> vlogger and video editor</em>, producing lifestyle and travel content.
                    I handle all aspects of production, including filming, editing, and audience engagement.

                    <br />
                    My most viewed video reached <strong>40,000+ views</strong>, and several others gained consistent traction,
                    demonstrating my ability to create engaging, shareable content.
                    This experience strengthened my skills in <strong>video editing</strong>,
                    <strong>storytelling</strong>, and <strong>digital media</strong>,
                    while also teaching me how to analyse audience metrics to grow viewership.

                    making drinks, delivering food, and attending to customers in a fast-paced environment. <br />
                    <br />
                    Learned to manage <strong>high-volume orders efficiently</strong> while maintaining
                    <strong> customer satisfaction</strong> through friendly and attentive service. <br />
